# CleaningDataWeek4Project

How it works
1. The script must be placeed inside the directory created after extracting the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip file.

2. The script first created a dataframe with the test data and then with the training data and then merges both of them.

3. After merging it extracts the mean and standard deviation columns. 

4. It then summarizes the data based on subject and activity by runnign mean on all the readings.
